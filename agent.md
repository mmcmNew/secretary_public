This repository contains a Flask backend and a React frontend. The backend already includes the built frontend under `server/app/dist`.

## How to run
Use the `start.sh` script in the repository root to create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies and run the server.

```bash
./start.sh
```

The application will be available at `https://localhost:5000`.

To work on the React client in development mode:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
